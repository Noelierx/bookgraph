## üß© Notable Implementations

- **Descriptions**: gracefully extracted from strings or `{ value }` objects, with fallbacks to *work* or *edition* data.  
- **ISBN handling**: cleans multiple identifier fields (`isbn`, `isbn_10`, `isbn_13`, `identifiers`); prefers ISBN-13 and converts from ISBN-10 if needed.  
- **Multi-source enrichment**: combines data from OpenLibrary and Google Books APIs, with intelligent deduplication and merging of subjects/categories.  
- **Graph resizing**: dynamically fits its container using `ResizeObserver`.

## üîß Enrichment Architecture

BookGraph uses a sophisticated multi-source enrichment pipeline:

- **Primary Sources**: OpenLibrary API and Google Books API
- **Intelligent Merging**: Combines data from multiple sources, preferring more complete information
- **Category Integration**: Google Books categories are automatically mapped to book subjects
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate subjects and handles various ISBN formats
- **Fallback Logic**: If exact matches aren't found, uses best available results to maximize data coverage
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between API calls to respect service limits

The enrichment service (`enrichmentService.ts`) centralizes all this logic, making it easy to maintain and extend.
