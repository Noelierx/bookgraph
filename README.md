## 📚 Goodreads Import

BookGraph supports importing your Goodreads library via CSV export:

### How to Export from Goodreads:
1. Go to **Goodreads.com** → **My Books**
2. Click **Import and export** at the bottom of the left sidebar
3. Click **Export Library** and download your CSV file

### Import Process:
1. Click **Import from Goodreads** in BookGraph
2. Select your downloaded CSV file
3. BookGraph will automatically:
   - Parse your library data (Title, Author, ISBN)
   - Enrich each book with additional metadata from OpenLibrary and Google Books
   - Merge subjects and categories for better connections
   - Remove duplicates and handle various ISBN formats

**Note:** Large libraries may take several minutes to import due to API enrichment and rate limiting.

---

## 🧩 Notable Implementations

- **Descriptions**: gracefully extracted from strings or `{ value }` objects, with fallbacks to *work* or *edition* data.  
- **ISBN handling**: cleans multiple identifier fields (`isbn`, `isbn_10`, `isbn_13`, `identifiers`); prefers ISBN-13 and converts from ISBN-10 if needed.  
- **Multi-source enrichment**: combines data from OpenLibrary and Google Books APIs, with intelligent deduplication and merging of subjects/categories.  
- **Graph resizing**: dynamically fits its container using `ResizeObserver`.

## 🔧 Enrichment Architecture

BookGraph uses a sophisticated multi-source enrichment pipeline:

- **Primary Sources**: OpenLibrary API and Google Books API
- **Intelligent Merging**: Combines data from multiple sources, preferring more complete information
- **Category Integration**: Google Books categories are automatically mapped to book subjects
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate subjects and handles various ISBN formats
- **Fallback Logic**: If exact matches aren't found, uses best available results to maximize data coverage
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between API calls to respect service limits

The enrichment service (`enrichmentService.ts`) centralizes all this logic, making it easy to maintain and extend.

---

## 💡 Notes

- Data is saved in **localStorage** under the key `book-graph-data`.  
- Enrichment uses **OpenLibrary** and **Google Books** APIs — may take a few seconds for large collections due to rate limiting and API delays.  
- **Goodreads imports** automatically enrich all books with metadata from multiple sources, which can take several minutes for large libraries.  
- Google Books categories are automatically merged into book subjects for better categorization.  
- If a book doesn't connect to others, try adding or refining its **description** or **subjects**, then click *Analyze* again.  
- The enrichment service intelligently combines data from multiple sources, preferring more complete information while avoiding duplicates.
